## üß† 1. Overview
The AppliFlow backend is designed to support a unified job application system that connects a Chrome extension and a web dashboard. The backend will handle authentication, job tracking, document management, AI-driven enhancements for resumes and cover letters, and analytics. Moreover, it will integrate with Google Drive/Docs for document storage and editing while providing the groundwork for automated job record creation upon final submission on a job website.

## üîê 2. User Authentication & Authorization
**Requirements:**
- **User Sign-Up / Login:**
  - Support traditional email/password authentication.
  - Include Google OAuth for streamlined sign-in.

- **Protected Endpoints:**
  - Secure certain routes so that only authenticated users can access job tracking and document management features.

- **User Profiles & Preferences:**
  - Store user data such as name, email, and application preferences (e.g., default job type, resume back prompts).

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use JWT for session management.
- Consider Passport.js or similar libraries for integrating Google OAuth.
- Design a User model that includes profile data, settings, and references to job entries.

---

## üìÇ 3. Job Tracker Management
**Requirements:**
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Allow users to create, read, update, and delete job entries.
  - Users should be able to manually add jobs and have jobs automatically created upon final submission on a job website (via the Chrome extension).

- **Job Data Fields:**
  - Posting Link: URL to the job posting.
  - Job Title
  - Company
  - Applied Date
  - Docs Used: A reference to the folder that contains the corresponding resume and cover letter.
  - Status: Options include "Applied" (default), "Interview," "Cancelled," and "Offer."

- **Sorting & Filtering:**
  - Provide functionality to sort and filter job records.
  - Sorting can be implemented via query parameters on the API or via client-side rendering.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Define API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Integrate with the extension so that when the final submit on Workaday is detected, a job record is auto-created.
- When a job is created, coordinate with Document Management to create a corresponding Google Drive subfolder; save its URL in the job record.
- Allow users to edit existing job records (add, remove, or update jobs).

---

## üóÉÔ∏è 4. Document Management
**Requirements:**
- **User Document Setup:**
  - Upon account creation, allow users to upload their resume and cover letters or link to Google Docs.

- **Folder Structure in Google Drive:**
  - Automatically create a folder named "AppliFlow docs" in the user‚Äôs Google Drive.
  - For each job in the tracker, create a subfolder inside "AppliFlow docs" using a naming convention (job posting title followed by company).
  - Store the resume and cover letter for that job (in DOC, Google Docs, or PDF format) within this subfolder.

- **Data Linking:**
  - Ensure that the "Docs Used" field in the job record references the URL of the created subfolder.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Integrate with the Google Drive API using OAuth for authorized file access.
- Develop endpoints to:
  - Create and manage the "AppliFlow docs" folder.
  - Automatically generate subfolders upon job creation.
  - Handle file uploads or linking to existing Google Docs.
- Ensure security and access control for document operations.

## ü§ñ 5. AI-Driven Features
**Requirements:**
- **Resume Optimization & ATS Analysis:**
  - Analyze the resume to provide an ATS optimization score.
  - Generate actionable recommendations for improving work experiences.

- **Cover Letter Generation:**
  - Generate tailored cover letters based on the job description and resume context.

- **Work Experience Customization:**
  - Allow users to specify the number of bullet points per work experience.
  - Capture the entire job description from a job page and run it through an AI to generate suggested edits.
  - Enable toggling between work experience entries and auto-fill fields on the work application page.
  - Provide a mechanism for updating the corresponding Google Docs file (modify resume content with accepted changes).

- **Session Persistence:**
  - Ensure that the job session remains active until the user explicitly clears or saves it.

- **Drag & Drop:**
  - In the extension under the "Docs" tab, allow users to drag and drop a resume from Google Drive.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Create API endpoints that interface with your chosen AI service (e.g., Gemini AI).
- Develop a modular layer for AI interactions to generate cover letters, ATS scores, and impact statements.
- Implement robust error handling for external API calls.
- Consider updating Google Docs via the Google Docs API for seamless in-document editing.

---

## üìä 6. Analytics & History Tracking
**Requirements:**
- **ATS Score & Impact Metrics:**
  - Track historical ATS scores and changes over time.

- **Job Application History:**
  - Maintain an audit log of each job‚Äôs status changes and updates.

- **Reporting:**
  - Create endpoints to aggregate and serve this historical data for visualization on the dashboard.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Extend your database models to include audit trails and history logs.
- Build analytical endpoints that support filtering and aggregation.
- Integrate with the frontend dashboard for displaying charts and historical trends.

---

## üîå 7. Integration with External Services
**Requirements:**
- **Google Drive/Docs Integration:**
  - As described in Document Management, integrate with Google APIs for file/folder operations.

- **Authentication via Google OAuth:**
  - Ensure seamless integration with Google services by using OAuth for authentication.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use well-documented Google API libraries (such as googleapis for Node.js).
- Ensure your OAuth flow returns the required permissions (scope) for managing the user‚Äôs drive and docs.
- Test synchronization between your backend and Google Drive.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 8. Deployment & Infrastructure
**Requirements:**
- **Tech Stack:**
  - Backend: Node.js with Express.
  - Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (if a relational approach is preferred).
  - Authentication: JWT with Google OAuth integration.

- **Server Setup & Hosting:**
  - Use cloud providers such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

- **Security & Middleware:**
  - Implement CORS, input sanitization, rate limiting, and error logging.

- **CI/CD & Monitoring:**
  - Set up automated pipelines for testing and deployment.
  - Monitor application performance and security.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Organize the codebase into modular components (controllers, models, routes, config).
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration data.
- Ensure robust testing (unit, integration) before production deployment.

---

## üí° 9. Additional Considerations
**User Experience (UX):**
- Provide a polished frontend that closely interacts with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- Ensure responsive design and smooth interactions in both the Chrome extension and dashboard.

**Scalability:**
- Design the backend and API endpoints to scale as usage increases.

**Maintenance:**
- Document every module extensively and invest in unit tests.
- Plan for periodic updates, security patches, and performance optimizations.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 10. Next Steps & Implementation Roadmap
**Finalize Feature List & API Documentation:**
- Create an API specification (using Swagger/OpenAPI) that details every endpoint, request/response format, and authentication flow.

**Project Initialization:**
- Set up a new repository (or folder) with the backend structure outlined above.
- Initialize the project with Node.js and install required dependencies.

**Implement Core Endpoints:**
- **Authentication:** Build sign-up, login, and OAuth endpoints.
- **Job Tracker:** Create CRUD endpoints for job entries.
- **Document Management:** Develop endpoints to manage folders and file uploads via Google Drive API.

**Develop AI Integration Endpoints:**
- Implement endpoints that act as wrappers around AI service calls for cover letter generation, ATS analysis, and impact statement creation.

**Build Analytics & Logging:**
- Implement history tracking and reporting endpoints for ATS scores and application status changes.

**Testing & Iteration:**
- Use tools such as Postman to thoroughly test each endpoint.
- Write unit and integration tests.

**Deployment:**
- Deploy the backend to a cloud service.
- Set up proper CI/CD pipelines.

**Frontend & Extension Integration:**
- Once the backend is stable, update the Chrome extension and dashboard frontend to interact with the live API endpoints.
